'''
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Implementation using -
Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm commonly used for loop detection in linked lists. We use two pointers at different speeds:

A slow pointer that moves one step at a time.
A fast pointer that moves two steps at a time.
When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will have reached the middle.

        slow = fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
        # When loop breaks, slow will be at the middle node
        return slow
